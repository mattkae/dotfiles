# Matt's Dotfiles for Miracle on Ubuntu
These dotfiles are tailored for [miracle-wm](https://github.com/miracle-wm-org/miracle-wm)
on Ubuntu 24.04. The installation is geared toward Ubuntu 24.04 users, but you may extend
it to include whatever you personally like. These dotfiles are very much geared towards
my (corporate-ish) development life that largely revolves around C++, web, python,
and other types of development.

Some dependencies that are not packaged in the Ubuntu archive are built from
source here.

I very much enjoy Dracula theming, so that's what you'll be getting if you
install this ðŸ§›
