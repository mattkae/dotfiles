# Matt's Dotfiles for Miracle on Ubuntu
These dotfiles are tailored for [miracle-wm](https://github.com/miracle-wm-org/miracle-wm)
on Ubuntu 25.10. The installation is geared toward Ubuntu 25.10 users, but you may extend
it to include whatever you personally like. These dotfiles are very much geared towards
my (corporate-ish) development life that largely revolves around C++, web, python,
and other types of development.

Some dependencies that are not packaged in the Ubuntu archive are built from
source here.

I very much enjoy Dracula theming, so that's what you'll be getting if you
install this ðŸ§›

## Install
First, clone the repo:
```sh
git clone git@github.com:mattkae/dotfiles.git
```

**WARNING**: This next step will be destructive to existing configuration files,
so please run at your own risk.

Next, install:

```sh
cd dotfiles
./install.sh
```

## Directories
- `~/.local/bin`: local scripts
- `~/.local/src`: local source projects
- `~/.local/share/wallpapers`: images for background and lockscreen

## Configurations
The primary configuration is `~/.config/miracle-wm/config.yaml`. Users may place
any machine-specific configuration in `~/config/miracle-wm/user-config.yaml`.
For example, I run `xdg-desktop-portal-wlr` there so that screensharing works.
